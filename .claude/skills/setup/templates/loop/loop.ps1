# Autonomous feature loop for {{PROJECT_NAME}} — drives one `auto-loop` iteration per
# fresh-context CLI run. State lives in _goals/backlog.md + git, never in memory.
#
# Twin: loop.sh (bash) — behaviorally identical — same
# defaults, guards, and exit codes; any divergence is a bug.
#
# Usage:   pwsh _loop/loop.ps1 [MaxIterations]   (default 10)
# CLI:     override with $env:LOOP_CLI, e.g. $env:LOOP_CLI = "codex exec" or "claude -p"
# SLOTS:   override with $env:LOOP_SLOTS (default 2, clamped [1,3]) -- N>1 is
#          honored only when $env:LOOP_WORKTREE = 1 (worktree isolation makes
#          concurrent slots sound); otherwise effective concurrency is held at 1.
# WORKTREE: override with $env:LOOP_WORKTREE = 1 to run each iteration in its
#          own git worktree under .loop-worktrees/ (default 0 = main tree,
#          today's behavior).
#
# SAFETY: run inside a sandbox (worktree/container) with minimal credentials.
# This script never pushes and never bypasses permission prompts by itself.
#
# Breaker: dot-sources breaker.ps1 (functions: Breaker-Load, Breaker-ShouldSkip,
# Breaker-Record, Breaker-CurrentModel); state file: _goals/breaker-state.json.
#
# Exit codes (driver-aggregated across slots, precedence 4>3>2>1>0 -- the most
# severe cause is always the one reported):
# 0 = backlog complete -- the driver's own backlog re-scan found no eligible
# story and no branch was quarantined this run. Under driver-owned dispatch a
# slot-emitted sentinel is an ITERATION-mismatch (contract violation), never a
# completion signal; the sentinel decides completion only in MANUAL
# (non-dispatched) auto-loop runs.
# 1 = stopped without completing the backlog -- max iterations reached with
# eligible stories remaining, or no eligible story remains but quarantined
# branches were retained this run (inspect them before trusting the backlog).
# 2 = circuit breaker -- every slot retired on no-progress (a slot retires,
# and is no longer refilled, after 3 consecutive no-commit reaps).
# 3 = circuit breaker -- every slot retired and at least one retirement was
# for 5 consecutive identical failure signatures (per-slot lineage).
# 4 = protected-path modification detected (iteration reverted; the run stops
# immediately and every other running slot is killed).
# 126/127 (shell-propagated edge cases, not loop-owned codes): command-not-found
# propagates as exit 127 and found-but-not-executable as exit 126 (bash) --
# standard shell convention, distinct from the aggregated codes above. The
# PowerShell twin's Get-Command guard does not attempt to distinguish the two
# and exits 127 for both -- a stated, knowingly-accepted platform difference
# (the 126 case is Unix-host-only).
# Exit 5 = setup or integration failure: the LOOP_WORKTREE=1 tracked-instance
# preflight failing after `git worktree add`, PROMPT.md missing a %%...%%
# substitution point, a missing/unreadable _goals/backlog.md, or the
# rebase-then-ff integration step hitting a non-fast-forward -- all loud,
# driver-level stops that never silently fall back to the main tree (the
# preflight path removes its worktree; the non-ff path retains worktree and
# branch for inspection).

# iteration fans out many subagents (implementer/test-writer execute, evaluator
# verifies every task, fixes are always re-evaluated), and that per-iteration
# fan-out multiplies by N against a shared ~20-concurrent subagent-spawn
# ceiling; (2) all N slots would authenticate through the same LOOP_CLI as one
# provider account, so they would share ONE rate-limit budget -- more slots
# raise request rate against an unchanged quota rather than adding real
# throughput; (3) the circuit breaker is provider-global (one state file, one
# 600s cooldown) -- a single OPEN trip stalls ALL N slots at once, so more
# slots raise the odds of a full-run stall without shortening it. N=3 crowds
# fact (1) hardest, which is why 2 (not 3) is the design default.
