name: setup
description: Install the orchestrator/worker/evaluator multi-agent system into the current project, compiled for its AI coding harness(es) — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), and/or OpenAI Codex. Generates the six subagents (evaluator, qa-evaluator, implementer, test-writer, terminal, diagnostician) with tiered model pins — terminal is light-tier, running any Bash or PowerShell command and returning only the result the caller asked for — plus the orchestrator skills (feature, research), the criteria skills, an optional autonomous feature loop, and a project-specific ORCHESTRATION.md. On empty or near-empty (greenfield) directories it first asks whether to scaffold a project tree and creates nothing until the user confirms. After inspect, suggests skills.sh skills from inspection signals. Run once per project; re-run to upgrade or re-target.

# Setup (Orchestration Kit Compiler)

You are installing a multi-agent orchestration system (orchestrator coordinates,
worker subagents execute with fresh context, skeptical evaluators verify) into the
**current project**. The kit keeps ONE canonical template source in Claude Code format
(`templates/`). `bin/emit.sh` / `emit.ps1` compiles it per harness; `emitters/`
are caveats only. Consult `reference/harness-matrix.md` for verified capabilities and friction points —
when live harness docs contradict it, trust the docs and update the matrix.

Skim `templates/ORCHESTRATION.md` first so you understand what you are instantiating.

## Step 1 — Detect target harness(es)

Evidence: existing `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or
`.github/agents/`, `.codex/` or `AGENTS.md`; plus the session you are running in.
Present what you detected and ask which harnesses to target — **multiple is normal**
(the canonical `.claude/` tree already serves VS Code partially; see the matrix).
Cursor's emitter is self-contained: targeting Cursor emits its own full `.cursor/`
tree. If any destination file exists, list collisions and ask before overwriting —
unless a kit manifest exists (see Upgrading below).

## Step 2a — Greenfield gate

**Run order (hard):** run this step after Step 1 and **before** Step 2, despite the
`2a` label. Evaluate it **once per `/setup` session** — evaluate the sparse heuristic
and ask at most once per invocation. After a confirmed generic tree (paths that sit on
the allowlist below), do not re-enter Step 2a; the only hand-back target is Step 2,
never Step 2a.

### Sparse heuristic

The workspace is sparse **only if every present file** is on this allowlist:

- `.git/` (any contents)
- `.gitignore`
- `LICENSE`
- `README*` (any suffix)
- `.editorconfig`
- `.gitattributes`
- `.DS_Store`
- `Thumbs.db`
- empty directories

**Any other file** means **not sparse** — including `skills/setup/SKILL.md`, anything
under `tests/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, or `src/`, a language manifest,
`orchestration-kit.manifest.json`, `notes.md`, or `main.py`.

Worked negative example: a repo containing `skills/setup/SKILL.md`, or a non-empty
`tests/` directory, is **not** sparse and must skip Step 2a.

**Hard rule — not sparse:** skip **entirely** `## Step 2a — Greenfield gate` (no
scaffold offer) and continue with Step 2 inspect; Step 2b still runs.

**Hard rule — sparse:** **always ask** whether to scaffold a new project. Never
silently scaffold; never skip the question.

### Decline path

If the user declines the scaffold: create no scaffold files, set `flags.greenfield` in the answers file (Step 4) to `false`, and continue with the
normal inspect → interview → emit path.

### Accept path — guide, then confirm

1. Interview the stack with three choices only: **TypeScript/Node**, **Python**, or
   **Other**.
2. Present the matching frozen tree below as a list of paths — do not create anything
   yet. **Guide-then-confirm (hard):**
   create nothing until the user explicitly confirms that tree.
   No Write and no `mkdir` of scaffold paths before that confirmation. If they reject
   the presented tree, revise it and wait again — still create nothing.
3. After confirmation, create **exactly** the confirmed paths.
4. **Never overwrite:** if a confirmed path already exists, skip it and report the
   skip.

Frozen trees — create these after confirm and nothing else (no sample production
module, no failing test file, no CI):

| Stack | Paths to create after confirmation |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| **TypeScript/Node** | `package.json` (minimal: `name` from the project/folder name, `"private": true`), `tsconfig.json` (minimal `compilerOptions` sufficient for `src/`), `.gitignore` (at least `node_modules/` and `dist/`), `README.md` (title), `src/`, `tests/` |
| **Python** | `pyproject.toml` (minimal `[project]` name + version), `.gitignore` (at least `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.egg-info/`), `README.md` (title), `src/`, `tests/` |
| **Other / generic** | `.gitignore`, `README.md` (title), `src/`, `tests/` — no language manifest |

Skill suggestions run in Step 2b for every project (see below).

### Accept-path hand-back (hard)

After confirmed tree creation, the flow continues at Step 2 — Inspect the repo on the newly
created tree, then Step 2b skill suggestions, then Step 3 interview, then Steps 4–6 emit. This gate never ends the
skill.

### Greenfield token disposition (hard)

The frozen trees include **no** test runner and no failing test file, so nothing about
testing can be inferred from them. Step 3 **must ask** for the targeted and full test
commands, the setup commands, and the test framework name(s), and **must never invent**
`npm test` / `pytest`. Record the four inference-only values in answers `tokens`:

| Token | User supplied a value | User has none |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| `TARGETED_TEST_COMMAND` | the user's command | `(not configured)` |
| `FULL_TEST_COMMAND` | the user's command | `(not configured)` |
| `TEST_FRAMEWORKS` | the user's name(s) | `not configured` |
| `SETUP_COMMANDS` | the user's command | TypeScript/Node accept path: `npm install`; Python accept path: `pip install -e .`; Other or decline: `(not configured)` |

Omit `LINT_COMMAND` / `TYPECHECK_COMMAND` from `tokens` when the matching flag is false.

### Greenfield signal (hard)

Set `flags.greenfield` in the answers file (Step 4) to `true` only when the user
accepted and confirmed a tree, otherwise `false`. The emitter writes
`options.greenfield` from it. Do not rely on remembering which branch ran.

## Step 2 — Inspect the repo

Step 2a has already run (sparse workspace) or was skipped entirely (not sparse); either
way, inspect now and never re-enter the gate.

Establish from the code (do not ask what you can read):

- Language(s), runtime, package manager, workspace layout
- Exact commands for **targeted** tests (one file / pattern) and the **full** suite(s)
- Lint / type-check / build commands **that are actually configured** — never invent
- Code lanes/layers and their dependency order
- User-facing surfaces: CLIs, API endpoints, web UI, library entry points
- Existing skills/agents/rules — enumerate installed skill directories under
  `.claude/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, `.agents/skills`, and `.github/skills` (each
  subdirectory name is an installed skill); per-directory `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, canonical docs
- External services the code talks to (these must be mocked in tests)
- Enumerate `git remote -v` and classify each remote per the forge taxonomy in
  `templates/ORCHESTRATION.md` § Forge adapter (Phase 7 delivery)

## Step 2b — Skill suggestions

Runs for **every project** — greenfield accept path, greenfield decline path, and
non-sparse (existing) repos — **once per** interactive `/setup` session, after Step 2
inspect so the signals below are known. Workflow reference:
https://www.skills.sh/vercel-labs/skills/find-skills — the find-skills skill itself is
**not** installed and **not** vendored; its workflow is embedded here.

1. **Derive queries** from Step 2 inspection using the signal table below.
2. **Leaderboard first**: check https://skills.sh/ for a well-known skill covering each
   signal before running the CLI.
3. **Search**: `npx skills find <query>` per derived query (optionally `--owner <owner>`
   to scope).
4. **Verify quality** before recommending: install count and publisher. Offer a skill only if its install count is 1000 or more. Prefer listings whose GitHub owner is
   `vercel-labs` or `anthropics`; also prefer `microsoft` when it meets the floor. Still
   show other publishers that meet the floor. Never list a skill under 1000.
5. **Present**: each candidate with skill name, what it does, install count, source
   (`owner/repo`), install command, and a skills.sh link. Present at most 8 candidates in total and at most 3 per signal, ranked by install count. Ties break toward the
   preferred publishers.
6. **User picks** zero or more. Never auto-install.
7. **Install** project-local with exactly:

`npx skills add <owner>/<repo> --skill <picked-skill> -y`
Never pass -g (project-local only).

**Why `--skill` is required:** `-y` skips confirmation and accepts defaults — without
`--skill` the CLI installs **every** skill in that source, which is auto-install and
out of scope. Optional `-a <agent>` only when the CLI agent id for a Step 1 harness is
known; otherwise omit `-a` (do not guess). Do not vendor installed copies into the
kit's `templates/` tree.

8. **Fail-open**: if `npx` is missing, the command exits non-zero, or the network is
   unavailable, do not abort `/setup`; print the exact `npx skills add …` commands to
   run later, then continue to Step 3.

**No results** for a query: say so and move on; never fabricate a candidate.

| Signal | Evidence (from Step 2 inspect) | Queries for npx skills find |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Language / runtime** | e.g. `package.json` + `tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`, `*.csproj`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml` | `typescript`, `python`, `dotnet`, `go`, `rust` |
| **Web UI present** | e.g. `react` / `next` / `vue` / `svelte` / `@angular` dependencies, `*.razor`, HTML templates + CSS, `tailwind.config.*` | `web design`, `ui`, the framework name, `accessibility` |
| **Test framework** | e.g. `[tool.pytest]` / `pytest.ini` / `conftest.py`, `jest.config.*` / `vitest.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`, xunit / NUnit package refs | `pytest`, `jest`, `vitest`, `playwright`, `testing` |
| **Backend / web framework** | e.g. `fastapi` / `django` / `flask`, `express` / `fastify` / `next`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore`, Spring | the framework name |
| **Infra / DevOps** | e.g. `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*`, Kubernetes manifests, `*.tf`, `*.bicep`, `.github/workflows/` | `docker`, `kubernetes`, `terraform`, `bicep`, `github actions` |
| **Docs surfaces** | e.g. `docs/`, `mkdocs.yml`, `docusaurus.config.*` | `documentation` |
| **Databases / ORMs** | e.g. `prisma/`, `sqlalchemy` / `alembic`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`, `migrations/` | `prisma`, `sqlalchemy`, `database` |

A signal that is absent produces no query.

The agent may add **1–3 extra queries** beyond the table, each justified by a named
inspection file (worked example: `requirements.txt` lists `langchain` → `langchain`). No
extra query without named evidence.

Worked examples: a repo with a web UI → e.g. offer a web design / UI guidance skill; a
repo with `pytest` configured → e.g. offer a Python / pytest best-practices skill. Do
not promise a specific skill name or install count.

On a freshly scaffolded tree only the language signal is present, so the search reduces
to the stack query (`typescript` / `node` or `python`).

Before presenting, enumerate installed skill directories: `.claude/skills/*/`,
`.cursor/skills/*/`, `.agents/skills/*/`, `.github/skills/*/` (a skill is installed if
a directory with its name exists in any of them). Never re-offer a skill that is already installed. List installed matches to the user as already installed.

## Step 3 — Interview the user

Ask (multiple-choice where possible) only what you could not infer:

1. **Project name** as it should appear in docs (propose one).
2. **Execution layer order** — confirm your inferred chain.
3. **Model tiers** — for each target harness: pick CURRENT frontier and light
   model IDs (check the harness's live model list; IDs rotate). Offer
   "inherit/unpinned" as an option (`flags.models_pinned` false).
4. **QA gate surfaces** — which user-facing surfaces qa-evaluator covers; any existing
   evidence-producing skills (API smoke, visual QA)?
5. **Research workflow** — wanted? Record `flags.research`.
6. **Autonomous loop** — wanted? If yes: confirm sandbox strategy (worktree/container),
   max iterations, and that commits stay local (no auto-push) unless they say otherwise.
   Record `flags.loop`.
7. **Delivery forge (Phase 7)** — present the detected forge and the chosen remote.
   Confirm or override with any of `github` / `azuredevops` / `gitlab` / `none`
   (plus `forgeHost` for self-hosted). The `ship-pr` skill is always emitted;
   `none` means the draft + hand-over branch.
8. **Ground-truth doc** — the committed reference file for domain decisions.

The live model check happens here — the script never fetches anything. See `emitters/`
for each harness's live-check URL and silent-fallback / cost-tier warnings.

## Step 4 — Write the answers file

Write `orchestration-kit.answers.json` at the repo root (`schema: 1`). Id table:
`reference/bootstrap-ids.md`.

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "projectName": "…",
  "harnesses": ["claude-code"],
  "primary": "claude-code",
  "flags": { "research": true, "loop": true, "greenfield": false,
             "lint": true, "typecheck": false, "models_pinned": true },
  "forge": { "kind": "github", "host": "" },
  "tokens": { "PROJECT_NAME": "…", "STACK_SUMMARY": "…", "EXECUTION_LAYERS": "…" },
  "models": { "claude-code": { "frontier": "opus", "light": "sonnet",
                               "alt_family": "…", "frontier_alt_family": "…",
                               "loop_chain": "sonnet" } },
  "bootstrap": { "<id>": "verbatim replacement text", "other-id": "…" }
}
```

Skills installed in Step 2b are recorded through the existing bootstrap ids:
`bootstrap.domain-skill-rows` gains one table row per installed skill
(`| \`<skill>\` | Supporting | <one-line purpose> (\`owner/repo\`) |`) and
`bootstrap.layer-skill-map` maps the layer that produced the signal to the skill.
Only skills actually installed in this session or already present count as installed; printed fail-open commands do not.
When no project skills exist, those two ids are answered per the existing rules (`""`
deletes the comment).

Do **not** put derived keys in `tokens` (marked "derived — do not set" below).
`projectName` fills `PROJECT_NAME` when that token is absent. Omit `LINT_COMMAND` /
`TYPECHECK_COMMAND` when the matching flag is false. A bootstrap id may be
deliberately left unanswered when the project has nothing to say — the comment is
deleted (`""` counts as answered; a missing key is listed).

`$SETUP` is the directory containing this SKILL.md (e.g. `.claude/skills/setup`). Then loop:

```
bash $SETUP/bin/emit.sh --answers orchestration-kit.answers.json --check-answers
```

Ask the user about each listed id, fill `bootstrap`, and repeat `--check-answers`
until exit 0.

### Placeholder reference

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | Display name of the project |
| `{{STACK_SUMMARY}}` | 2–5 sentence stack note |
| `{{IDE_DIR}}` | derived — do not set. Config dir of the harness **being emitted**, resolved per emitter (`.claude`, `.cursor`, `.github`, `.codex`); single-copy shared artifacts (`_loop/*`) resolve it to the **primary** harness's dir |
| `{{MODEL_FRONTIER}}` / `{{MODEL_LIGHT}}` | derived — do not set. Tier → model ID for the primary harness (from the model map) |
| `{{CLAUDE_MODEL_*}}`, `{{CURSOR_MODEL_*}}`, `{{COPILOT_MODEL_*}}`, `{{CODEX_MODEL_*}}` | derived — do not set. Per-harness tier IDs (model map only) |
| `{{MODEL_ALT_FAMILY}}` | derived — do not set. Different-family model at light-comparable tier, used by fix-cycle rotation (model map) |
| `{{MODEL_FRONTIER_ALT_FAMILY}}` | derived — do not set. Different-family model at frontier tier, used by evaluator arbitration mode after cycle 3 (model map) |
| `{{LOOP_MODEL_CHAIN}}` | derived — do not set. Comma-separated loop fallback chain, first = preferred (from the model map's "Loop fallback chain" row); empty ⇒ the breaker still tracks state but never passes a model flag |
| `{{EXECUTION_LAYERS}}` | Dependency-ordered layer chain |
| `{{GROUND_TRUTH_DOC}}` | Committed domain ground-truth doc path |
| `{{QA_SURFACES}}` | User-facing surfaces + evidence each produces |
| `{{SETUP_COMMANDS}}` | Dependency install commands |
| `{{TARGETED_TEST_COMMAND}}` / `{{FULL_TEST_COMMAND}}` | Staged test commands |
| `{{TEST_FRAMEWORKS}}` | Test framework(s) in use |
| `{{LINT_COMMAND}}` / `{{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}}` | Only if configured; else omit from `tokens` |
| `{{EVALUATOR_AUTO_FAIL_TRIGGERS}}` / `{{QA_AUTO_FAIL_TRIGGERS}}` | Project-specific instant-fail conditions |

## Step 5 — Emit

Run the twin that fits this environment **inline** — the output is one line; the
terminal-spawn rule does not apply:

- `bash $SETUP/bin/emit.sh --answers orchestration-kit.answers.json`
- `pwsh $SETUP/bin/emit.ps1 --answers orchestration-kit.answers.json`

This kit repo's own dogfood uses `scripts/self-install.sh`. If `orchestration-kit.manifest.json` already exists, run with `--dry-run` first.

| Exit | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | ok | continue to Step 6 |
| 2 | usage / jq missing / answers unreadable | install `jq` or use `emit.ps1`; fix the path |
| 3 | answers invalid **or** `--check-answers` found unanswered ids | fix answers |
| 4 | user-modified files (listed on stderr) | show the user the listed files, ask, `--force` |
| 5 | verify failed | report the listed verify hits as a kit bug |
| 6 | template syntax | kit bug |

## Step 6 — Report

Read the summary line (`emit: written N · unchanged M · pruned P · seeds-kept S · warnings W · manifest orchestration-kit.manifest.json · kit <VERSION>`).
Delete `orchestration-kit.answers.json` (the manifest holds `answers`).
Report written / pruned / warnings and the next step (`/feature`).
The script writes the manifest; schema in `bin/README.md`.
Manifest `options` is flat — `"forge": "<detected>"` plus optional `forgeHost`.
`seedFiles` lists seeds (today `_goals/backlog.md`); they are never overwritten
on upgrade.

## Upgrading / re-running

A script-only `--upgrade` never runs Step 2b. A full interactive `/setup` re-run
does run it (skipping installed skills).

`bash $SETUP/bin/emit.sh --upgrade` (answers come from the manifest; add
`--answers` only when the interview changed). Exit 4 lists user-modified files;
show the user, then `--force` if they confirm. `--dry-run` prints planned actions
and still exits 4 when any path is blocked.

Prune: kit-owned paths in the previous manifest that are not in the new emit set
are deleted when unchanged, else kept and warned; seeds are never pruned.

pre-v0.27.0 installs have no `answers` — run Steps 1–4 once, then `--answers … --upgrade`.

On every re-run, re-detect the forge from the current remotes. If detection agrees
with the manifest, refresh silently. If it disagrees (remote migrated, e.g.
GitHub → Azure DevOps), surface both values and ask — never silently flip, never
keep a stale value unmentioned.

Paths listed in `seedFiles` are outside the overwrite flow: create a seed if it is
missing, otherwise leave it exactly as it is.
