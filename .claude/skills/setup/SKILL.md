name: setup
description: Install the orchestrator/worker/evaluator multi-agent system into the current project, compiled for its AI coding harness(es) — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), and/or OpenAI Codex. Generates the six subagents (evaluator, qa-evaluator, implementer, test-writer, terminal, diagnostician) with tiered model pins — terminal is light-tier: it runs any Bash or PowerShell command and returns only the result the caller asked for — plus the orchestrator skills (feature, research), the criteria skills, an optional autonomous feature loop, and a project-specific ORCHESTRATION.md. On empty or near-empty (greenfield) directories it first asks whether to scaffold a project tree and creates nothing until the user confirms. Run once per project; re-run to upgrade or re-target.

# Setup (Orchestration Kit Compiler)

You are installing a multi-agent orchestration system (orchestrator coordinates,
worker subagents execute with fresh context, skeptical evaluators verify) into the
**current project**. The kit keeps ONE canonical template source in Claude Code format
(`templates/`) and **compiles** it per harness via the instruction files in `emitters/`.
Consult `reference/harness-matrix.md` for verified capabilities and friction points —
when live harness docs contradict it, trust the docs and update the matrix.

Skim `templates/ORCHESTRATION.md` first so you understand what you are instantiating.

## Step 1 — Detect target harness(es)

Evidence: existing `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or
`.github/agents/`, `.codex/` or `AGENTS.md`; plus the session you are running in.
Present what you detected and ask which harnesses to target — **multiple is normal**
(the canonical `.claude/` tree already serves VS Code partially; see the matrix).
Cursor's emitter is self-contained: targeting Cursor emits its own full `.cursor/`
tree. If any destination file exists, list collisions and ask before overwriting —
unless a kit manifest exists (see Upgrading below).

## Step 2a — Greenfield gate

**Run order (hard):** run this step after Step 1 and **before** Step 2, despite the
`2a` label. Evaluate it **once per `/setup` session** — evaluate the sparse heuristic
and ask at most once per invocation. After a confirmed generic tree (paths that sit on
the allowlist below), do not re-enter Step 2a; the only hand-back target is Step 2,
never Step 2a.

### Sparse heuristic

The workspace is sparse **only if every present file** is on this allowlist:

- `.git/` (any contents)
- `.gitignore`
- `LICENSE`
- `README*` (any suffix)
- `.editorconfig`
- `.gitattributes`
- `.DS_Store`
- `Thumbs.db`
- empty directories

**Any other file** means **not sparse** — including `skills/setup/SKILL.md`, anything
under `tests/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, or `src/`, a language manifest,
`orchestration-kit.manifest.json`, `notes.md`, or `main.py`.

Worked negative example: a repo containing `skills/setup/SKILL.md`, or a non-empty
`tests/` directory, is **not** sparse and must skip Step 2a.

**Hard rule — not sparse:** skip **entirely** `## Step 2a — Greenfield gate` (no
scaffold offer, no skills.sh install step) and continue with Step 2 inspect below.

**Hard rule — sparse:** **always ask** whether to scaffold a new project. Never
silently scaffold; never skip the question.

### Decline path

If the user declines the scaffold: create no scaffold files, do not run the skills.sh
step, set `options.greenfield` to `false` at emit time (Step 6), and continue with the
normal inspect → interview → emit path.

### Accept path — guide, then confirm

1. Interview the stack with three choices only: **TypeScript/Node**, **Python**, or
   **Other**.
2. Present the matching frozen tree below as a list of paths — do not create anything
   yet. **Guide-then-confirm (hard):**
   create nothing until the user explicitly confirms that tree.
   No Write and no `mkdir` of scaffold paths before that confirmation. If they reject
   the presented tree, revise it and wait again — still create nothing.
3. After confirmation, create **exactly** the confirmed paths.
4. **Never overwrite:** if a confirmed path already exists, skip it and report the
   skip.

Frozen trees — create these after confirm and nothing else (no sample production
module, no failing test file, no CI):

| Stack | Paths to create after confirmation |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| **TypeScript/Node** | `package.json` (minimal: `name` from the project/folder name, `"private": true`), `tsconfig.json` (minimal `compilerOptions` sufficient for `src/`), `.gitignore` (at least `node_modules/` and `dist/`), `README.md` (title), `src/`, `tests/` |
| **Python** | `pyproject.toml` (minimal `[project]` name + version), `.gitignore` (at least `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.egg-info/`), `README.md` (title), `src/`, `tests/` |
| **Other / generic** | `.gitignore`, `README.md` (title), `src/`, `tests/` — no language manifest |

### Accept path — skills.sh stack skills (greenfield only)

Runs on the accept path only, after the tree exists and the stack is known. Search the
skills.sh leaderboard first, then `npx skills find` for the chosen stack (`typescript`
/ `node`, or `python`). Workflow reference:
https://www.skills.sh/vercel-labs/skills/find-skills

Offer a skill only if its install count is 1000 or more. Prefer listings whose GitHub
owner is `vercel-labs` or `anthropics`; also prefer a listing whose owner is
`microsoft` when it meets the floor. Still show other publishers that meet the floor.
Never list a skill under 1000.

Present each candidate with: skill name, what it does, install count, source
(`owner/repo`), install command, and a skills.sh link. The user picks zero or more.
Install **project-local** with exactly:

`npx skills add <owner>/<repo> --skill <picked-skill> -y`
Never pass -g (project-local only).

**Why `--skill` is required:** `-y` skips confirmation and accepts defaults — without
`--skill` the CLI installs **every** skill in that source, which is auto-install and
out of scope. Optional `-a <agent>` only when the CLI agent id for a Step 1 harness is
known; otherwise omit `-a` (do not guess). Do not vendor installed copies into the
kit's `templates/` tree.

**Fail-open:** if `npx` is missing, the command exits non-zero, or the network is
unavailable, do not abort `/setup`. Print the exact `npx skills add …` commands for the
user to run later, then continue — never stop before inspect/emit.

### Accept-path hand-back (hard)

After confirmed tree creation **and** after the skills.sh step (including its
fail-open branch), the flow continues at Step 2 — Inspect the repo on the newly
created tree, then Step 3 interview, then Steps 4–6 emit. This gate never ends the
skill.

### Greenfield token disposition (hard)

The frozen trees include **no** test runner and no failing test file, so nothing about
testing can be inferred from them. Step 3 **must ask** for the targeted and full test
commands, the setup commands, and the test framework name(s), and **must never invent**
`npm test` / `pytest`. Then resolve the four inference-only tokens by this table. Every
`{{TOKEN}}` in the scratch copy must be replaced or its containing row/sentence
deleted, so Step 6's grep for `{{` stays at zero hits.

| Token | User supplied a value | User has none |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| `{{TARGETED_TEST_COMMAND}}` | replace **every** occurrence under `templates/` (today 5 sites: `ORCHESTRATION.md` code block, `agents/implementer.md`, `agents/test-writer.md`, `skills/test-ladder/SKILL.template.md`, `skills/task-criteria/SKILL.template.md` — **none** is a table row) | there is no token-only table row for this token; replace every occurrence with the literal `(not configured)` |
| `{{FULL_TEST_COMMAND}}` | replace **every** occurrence (today 9 sites; the only token-only table row among these four tokens is the `templates/ORCHESTRATION.md` Quality-checks / rung-3 row, plus 8 prose/code-block sites) | delete that table row if its cell is only this token; replace every remaining occurrence with `(not configured)` |
| `{{TEST_FRAMEWORKS}}` | replace the occurrence (`agents/test-writer.md` prose) | replace with `not configured` |
| `{{SETUP_COMMANDS}}` | replace the occurrence (`ORCHESTRATION.md` code block) | TypeScript/Node accept path: `npm install`; Python accept path: `pip install -e .`; Other or decline: `(not configured)` |

Do **not** analogize to the lint/typecheck "remove the row" rule: `{{LINT_COMMAND}}`
and `{{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}}` each occupy **exactly one** table row, so deleting the row
is complete. Every test/setup/framework token above has at least one **non-table** site
(prose or code block), so row-deletion alone always leaves a `{{` behind. The counts
above are a snapshot — the rule is replace every occurrence, not a frozen inventory.

### Greenfield signal (hard)

Record the branch in the Step 6 manifest `options`: `"greenfield": true` **only** when
the user accepted **and** confirmed a tree; otherwise `"greenfield": false`. Downstream
`<!-- BOOTSTRAP: ... -->` resolution keys off that flag — do not rely on remembering
which branch ran.

## Step 2 — Inspect the repo

Step 2a has already run (sparse workspace) or was skipped entirely (not sparse); either
way, inspect now and never re-enter the gate.

Establish from the code (do not ask what you can read):

- Language(s), runtime, package manager, workspace layout
- Exact commands for **targeted** tests (one file / pattern) and the **full** suite(s)
- Lint / type-check / build commands **that are actually configured** — never invent
- Code lanes/layers and their dependency order
- User-facing surfaces: CLIs, API endpoints, web UI, library entry points
- Existing skills/agents/rules, per-directory `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, canonical docs
- External services the code talks to (these must be mocked in tests)
- Enumerate `git remote -v` and classify each remote per the forge taxonomy in
  `templates/ORCHESTRATION.md` § Forge adapter (Phase 7 delivery)

## Step 3 — Interview the user

Ask (multiple-choice where possible) only what you could not infer:

1. **Project name** as it should appear in docs (propose one).
2. **Execution layer order** — confirm your inferred chain.
3. **Model tiers** — fill `templates/models.map.md` for each target harness: pick
   CURRENT frontier and light model IDs (check the harness's live model list; IDs
   rotate). Offer "inherit/unpinned" as an option (then strip model keys and the tier
   column from emitted files).
4. **QA gate surfaces** — which user-facing surfaces qa-evaluator covers; any existing
   evidence-producing skills (API smoke, visual QA)?
5. **Research workflow** — wanted? If not, skip the `research` skill and delete its
   section from ORCHESTRATION.md.
6. **Autonomous loop** — wanted? If yes: confirm sandbox strategy (worktree/container),
   max iterations, and that commits stay local (no auto-push) unless they say otherwise.
   If no: skip `templates/loop/` and delete the Autonomous Loop section.
7. **Delivery forge (Phase 7)** — present the detected forge and the chosen remote.
   Confirm or override with any of `github` / `azuredevops` / `gitlab` / `none`
   (plus `forgeHost` for self-hosted). The `ship-pr` skill is always emitted;
   `none` means the draft + hand-over branch.
8. **Ground-truth doc** — the committed reference file for domain decisions.

## Step 4 — Resolve the canonical templates

In a scratch copy, resolve every `{{TOKEN}}` and act on + delete every
`<!-- BOOTSTRAP: ... -->` comment in `templates/`. Rules:

- Table rows / sections that don't apply are removed, not left as placeholders.
- Evaluator auto-fail triggers must name **this project's** sins (from Step 2). Generic
  filler is a bootstrap failure.
- Model tiers resolve from the completed model map; keep the resolved
  `models.map.md` as the single place model IDs live.
- Every token resolves **once** in the scratch copy — with one exception: `{{IDE_DIR}}`
  is re-resolved **per emitter** whenever an emitter emits its own copy of a resolved
  file for its target harness (`.claude`, `.cursor`, `.github`, `.codex`), because each
  emitter's copy must point at its own config dir. No other token is re-resolved this
  way.

### Placeholder reference

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | Display name of the project |
| `{{STACK_SUMMARY}}` | 2–5 sentence stack note |
| `{{IDE_DIR}}` | Config dir of the harness **being emitted**, resolved per emitter (`.claude`, `.cursor`, `.github`, `.codex`); single-copy shared artifacts (`_loop/*`) resolve it to the **primary** harness's dir |
| `{{MODEL_FRONTIER}}` / `{{MODEL_LIGHT}}` | Tier → model ID for the primary harness (from the model map) |
| `{{CURSOR_MODEL_*}}`, `{{COPILOT_MODEL_*}}`, `{{CODEX_MODEL_*}}` | Per-harness tier IDs (model map only) |
| `{{MODEL_ALT_FAMILY}}` | Different-family model at light-comparable tier, used by fix-cycle rotation (model map) |
| `{{MODEL_FRONTIER_ALT_FAMILY}}` | Different-family model at frontier tier, used by evaluator arbitration mode after cycle 3 (model map) |
| `{{LOOP_MODEL_CHAIN}}` | Comma-separated loop fallback chain, first = preferred (from the model map's "Loop fallback chain" row); empty ⇒ the breaker still tracks state but never passes a model flag |
| `{{EXECUTION_LAYERS}}` | Dependency-ordered layer chain |
| `{{GROUND_TRUTH_DOC}}` | Committed domain ground-truth doc path |
| `{{QA_SURFACES}}` | User-facing surfaces + evidence each produces |
| `{{SETUP_COMMANDS}}` | Dependency install commands |
| `{{TARGETED_TEST_COMMAND}}` / `{{FULL_TEST_COMMAND}}` | Staged test commands |
| `{{TEST_FRAMEWORKS}}` | Test framework(s) in use |
| `{{LINT_COMMAND}}` / `{{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}}` | Only if configured; else remove rows |
| `{{EVALUATOR_AUTO_FAIL_TRIGGERS}}` / `{{QA_AUTO_FAIL_TRIGGERS}}` | Project-specific instant-fail conditions |

## Step 5 — Emit per harness

For each target harness, follow its emitter exactly:

| Harness | Emitter |
|---------|---------|
| Claude Code | `emitters/claude-code.md` |
| Cursor | `emitters/cursor.md` |
| GitHub Copilot (VS Code) | `emitters/copilot.md` |
| OpenAI Codex | `emitters/codex.md` |

Emitters compose: run Claude Code first when it is among the targets — VS Code reuses
parts of the emitted `.claude/` tree. The Cursor emitter is self-contained (it emits its
own full `.cursor/` tree and never reads `.claude/`), so it is order-independent
relative to the other emitters.

**Seed files (create if missing; never overwrite)**: `_goals/backlog.md` is emitted as
a *seed*, not as managed content — the user owns it from the first install onward.
Create it only when it does not exist; on every re-run or upgrade leave an existing
seed untouched, even when its recorded manifest hash no longer matches (see Step 6).

**Loop extras (all harnesses)**: both loop drivers (`_loop/loop.sh` and
`_loop/loop.ps1`), their circuit-breaker helper twins (`_loop/breaker.sh` and
`_loop/breaker.ps1`, sourced/dot-sourced by the drivers), and `_loop/PROMPT.md` are
always emitted for loop-enabled installs, regardless of target harness or detected OS —
the drivers refuse to dispatch without `PROMPT.md`, so every loop-enabled install emits
it even when Claude Code is not among the targets. The user picks the driver that
matches their platform at invocation time. If the loop is enabled,
append to the project's `.gitattributes` (create if missing) so parallel/append-only
state merges cleanly and the loop drivers always check out with the line endings
their interpreters require:

```
_goals/LEARNINGS.md merge=union
_goals/ESCALATIONS.md merge=union
_goals/*/orchestration-log.md merge=union
*.sh text eol=lf
*.ps1 text eol=lf
```

Also append `_goals/breaker-state.json` to the project's `.gitignore` (create if
missing) — this is runtime scratch written by the breaker helpers at run time and
must never enter commits. Append two more lines to the same list: `.loop-worktrees/`
(the per-slot worktree scratch created and destroyed by the driver at
`LOOP_WORKTREE=1`) and `_goals/breaker-state.json.tmp.*` (crash-orphaned temp files
left behind by the breaker's write-temp-then-rename, per STORY-009).

**Checks scripts on Windows**: the kit does not emit a structural-checks script
itself. If a project's install adopts one (as the kit's own repository does), emit a
`.ps1` twin with the same checks and exit semantics — the pattern mirrors the loop
drivers (`checks.sh` / `checks.ps1`, behaviorally identical, no OS-detection
branching).

## Step 6 — Manifest, verify, report

1. Write `orchestration-kit.manifest.json` at the project root:
   ```json
   {
     "kit": "ai-orchestration",
     "kitVersion": "<contents of VERSION>",
     "installedAt": "<ISO date>",
     "harnesses": ["claude-code", "..."],
     "options": { "research": true, "loop": false, "greenfield": false, "forge": "<detected>" },
     "files": { "<emitted path>": "<sha256>" },
     "seedFiles": ["_goals/backlog.md"]
   }
   ```
   `options.greenfield` is `true` **only** when Step 2a's accept path ran and the user
   confirmed a tree; on the decline path, or when Step 2a was skipped as not sparse, it
   is `false`.
   `options.forge` is one of `github`, `azuredevops`, `gitlab`, or `none`.
   Optional `"forgeHost"` maps a self-hosted host. A manifest override beats detection
   at ship-pr runtime.
   `seedFiles` lists the emitted paths that are seeds (today exactly one): their hash
   is recorded in `files` at emit time and is EXEMPT from the upgrade diff-confirm
   flow. Semantics:
   a seed's recorded hash is an emit-time record; drift is expected and is never read as user modification.
   `_goals/LEARNINGS.md`, `_goals/ESCALATIONS.md`, and `_goals/breaker-state.json`
   are runtime/user artifacts the kit does not emit — never manifested in `files` or
   `seedFiles`, no hash ever recorded.
2. Run each emitter's Verify section. Global check: grep every emitted file for `{{`
   and `BOOTSTRAP:` — zero hits. Also: `pwsh -NoProfile -Command` parser check on
   emitted `.ps1` files when pwsh is available; otherwise note the skip in the report.
3. Report: files emitted per harness, the layer order / commands / model tiers baked
   in, and how to start (`/feature` — or the harness's equivalent invocation).

## Upgrading / re-running

If `orchestration-kit.manifest.json` exists: compare its `kitVersion` to `VERSION`,
diff manifest hashes against the working tree to find user-modified files, regenerate
into the scratch copy, and show the user a diff for any file they modified before
overwriting it. Unmodified files update silently. Update the manifest last.

On every re-run, re-detect the forge from the current remotes. If detection agrees
with the manifest, refresh silently. If it disagrees (remote migrated, e.g.
GitHub → Azure DevOps), surface both values and ask — never silently flip, never
keep a stale value unmentioned.

**Stale-file pruning**: after regenerating the new emit set, compare it against the
previous manifest's `files` keys. A key present in the previous manifest but absent
from the new emit set names a file the kit no longer produces — delete it if it
matches its previously recorded hash (unmodified), or report it for the user to
remove themselves if its hash has drifted (user-modified — never silently delete
someone's edits). The v0.18.0 evaluator rename is the reference case: an upgrade
from a pre-rename install prunes the two pre-v0.18.0 verification-role agent copies —
the predecessors of today's `evaluator.md` and `qa-evaluator.md`, one per role — from
every manifest-keyed instance directory (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.github/`, `.codex/`,
per the harnesses that were targeted), leaving only the current `evaluator.md` /
`qa-evaluator.md` files behind.
**Limit**: manifest-key pruning only reaches files the manifest actually keys — it
does NOT reach un-keyed copies, such as a self-install's nested
`skills/setup/templates/` tree (a vendored copy of the kit's own canonical templates,
never entered into `files`). Those copies are stale until whatever install mechanism
created that nested copy is re-run; the pruning step here cannot detect or clean
them.

Paths listed in `seedFiles` are outside this flow: create a seed if it is missing,
otherwise leave it exactly as it is — never overwrite it, never diff-confirm it, and
never report its hash drift as a user modification (the recorded hash is an emit-time
record only). Runtime/user artifacts (`_goals/LEARNINGS.md`, `_goals/ESCALATIONS.md`,
`_goals/breaker-state.json`) have no manifest entry and are never touched.

**Pre-v0.19.0 dual-install migration**: upgrading a project that was installed before
v0.19.0 with both `claude-code` and `cursor` targeted adds the Cursor emitter's
self-contained copies — `.cursor/skills/*`, `.cursor/ORCHESTRATION.md`, and
`.cursor/skills/setup-models.map.md` — to the emit set and their paths as new keys in
the manifest's `files`. No stale-file prunes are expected from this change: previously
emitted `.cursor/` files are refreshed in place, not removed.
