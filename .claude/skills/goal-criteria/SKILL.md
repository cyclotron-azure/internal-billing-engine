# Goal Evaluation Criteria

Score each dimension; the verdict starts at 2/5 and must be earned.

**Hard-threshold rule**: the dimensions below are gates, not averages — one failing
dimension caps the verdict at NEEDS REVISION no matter how strong the rest are.

## 1. Discovery Coverage

Every decision recorded in the Phase 1 Q&A summary is reflected somewhere in the goal or
a task. An answered question that no task honors is a NEEDS REVISION.

## 2. Success Criteria Quality

Criteria are observable outcomes ("`command X` returns Y with exit code 0"), not
activities ("implement module X"). Each is verifiable by an evaluator without asking the user.

## 3. Task Decomposition

- Tasks follow the project's layer order (Store & schema → Ingest → Attribution & normalization → Rating & billing → Export & lake sync → Client rollout) and declare dependencies.
- Each task is completable by a fresh-context subagent from its file alone: exhaustive
  requirements, explicit files-to-read, explicit constraints, a targeted test command.
- A dedicated test task exists and covers every implementation task's output.

### Ownership contract (write-set disjointness)

Every task file carries an ownership block declaring `writes` / `reads` / `depends_on` /
`owner` / `rewrite_semantics`. Verify all seven checks:

1. **Declarations complete** — non-empty `writes` (explicit owned paths); `reads` are
   interface briefs, not full-file dependencies on another task's owned files — unless
   `depends_on` orders this task after that producer, in which case reading the finished
   file in full is legitimate; `depends_on` names every producer task whose output this
   task consumes; rewrite semantics stated per owned file (`whole-file` is the default;
   `targeted-insertion` for large shared documents a task extends rather than rewrites).
   A block still carrying the template's bracket-literal placeholder values (`[path]`,
   `[NN-name]`, `[implementer|test-writer]`) is a pristine block, and a pristine block
   counts as UNDECLARED rather than declared — the same fail-closed missing-block remedy
   applies (author real values, re-evaluate). `owner` must be one of `implementer` /
   `test-writer`; the evaluator additionally cross-checks it against the agent the
   orchestration log shows was dispatched for that task.
2. **Coverage** — the union of all tasks' `writes` equals the set of files the goal
   intends to change: no orphan edits (a planned change no task owns), no owned path
   the goal never asked for.
3. **Pairwise disjointness** — for every pair of tasks with no `depends_on` ordering
   between them, the two `writes` sets intersect in NOTHING. Resolve a shared path
   either by reassigning that file to a single owner task or by adding the explicit
   `depends_on` edge that serializes the writers.
4. **Single owner** — no file appears in more than one task's `writes` across the whole
   goal unless those tasks are strictly ordered.
5. **Acyclic dependencies** — the `depends_on` graph is a DAG.
6. **Contracts first** — any interface, schema, or scaffold that both a producer and a
   consumer task touch is created and frozen in an earlier task than its consumers.
7. **Hotspots** — shared/high-traffic files are either owned by exactly one task or
   serialized by dependency; never concurrently written.

Scoping clauses (apply before scoring the seven):

- **Orchestrator-owned carve-out.** Goal and task files and the other `_goals/`
  artifacts (orchestration log, backlog status fields, LEARNINGS/ESCALATIONS notes) are
  written by the orchestrator, as are the documentation surfaces Phase 6 owns **as
  listed in the `align-docs` skill's documentation surface map** — that map bounds the
  exemption; it does not widen to "any doc". All of these sit OUTSIDE the task
  write-set union: coverage and single-owner apply to task-owned product files only.
- **Missing ownership block.** A task file with no ownership block is NEEDS REVISION —
  fail closed, since an undeclared write-set is not an empty one. The remedy is to
  author the block from the task template and re-evaluate; it is not a decomposition
  defect and does not count toward re-decomposition.
- **Globs.** Explicit paths by default. A glob is legitimate only where the task owns
  the entire directory it matches, and any glob-vs-glob overlap counts as intersecting.

Any violation of the seven checks is NEEDS REVISION.

### Acceptance Criteria (Phase 3 gate)

Every task file MUST contain an `## Acceptance Criteria` section. Each numbered item
must name a verification method (unit test, integration test, command output, live
interaction, screenshot, or equivalent). A missing section, an empty section, or any
criterion without a stated verification method is NEEDS REVISION.

This is where the former Phase 4 contract gate's rigor now lives — validated once at
Phase 3 for all tasks before any implementation dispatch.

### Evaluation depth (`eval_depth`)

**Applicability**: this check applies only to goals created on or after kit v0.18.0 —
the version that introduced per-task contracts and `eval_depth`. A goal already in
flight when these templates landed is exempt: the absence of `eval_depth` there is
informational only, never a NEEDS REVISION cause. Treat a goal as v0.18.0+ when its
task files use the current `templates/task.md` ownership-contract shape (the one
carrying `eval_depth`); older task files predate the field by construction.

For v0.18.0+ goals: every task file declares `eval_depth: full` or `eval_depth: light`.
The default is `light`. `full` is REQUIRED (with the reason stated in the task file)
when the task is a contract/scaffold task, has interface consumers (a later task
builds on its output as an interface — tasks that merely mirror, document, or test
the output are NOT consumers), or writes agent files, criteria skills, loop
drivers/breakers, or shared infrastructure named in the goal. An unexplained `full`
on a task meeting none of those triggers is an informational note, not NEEDS
REVISION; a `light` on a task that meets a trigger IS NEEDS REVISION. A task
file missing the field entirely fails closed to `full` — flag it in the evaluation
output; do not reject the goal for the omission alone.

### Continuation ladder (`ladder:`)

The goal's `phases:` block must declare `ladder:` as `escalate` or `auto`. A missing
`ladder:` key is read as `escalate` (informational note only).

## 4. Scope Discipline

Out-of-scope section exists; no task smuggles in unrelated refactoring; no requirement
contradicts the constraints or the ground-truth doc (README.md).

## 5. Risk Coverage

Error paths (auth failures, empty/malformed data, pagination), migration/compatibility
concerns, and rollback are addressed by some task where relevant.

## 6. Devil's Advocate (required section of every goal evaluation)

Before the verdict, produce all five — informative, **never a veto** on its own:

1. **Steelman the strongest alternative approach** — the strongest version, not a
   strawman that's easy to defeat.
2. **Load-bearing assumptions** — things the goal treats as fixed that are actually
   choices.
3. **30-day pre-mortem** — "it's a month later and this shipped and failed; what
   happened?"
4. **At least one concrete alternative** sketch, so the chosen direction is a *chosen*
   direction.
5. **Risk acceptance** — which surfaced risks the goal implicitly accepts.

A DA finding forces NEEDS REVISION only when it reveals an unaddressed risk that a
success criterion or task should cover.

## Verdicts

- **PASS**: all six dimensions solid; a fresh executor could run task 01 right now.
- **NEEDS REVISION**: fixable gaps — list every one (goal loops back at most 3 times).
- **REJECT**: the decomposition or approach is wrong; the user must decide.
