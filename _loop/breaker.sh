#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Model circuit breaker for the internal-billing-engine autonomous loop — CLOSED/OPEN/
# HALF-OPEN state machine that degrades to cheaper models on rate limits and
# self-heals. Sourced by the loop driver (`loop.sh`); never executed directly.
#
# Twin: breaker.ps1 (PowerShell 7+) — behaviorally
# identical — same states, thresholds, transitions, and schema; any divergence is a
# bug. Function-name mapping (bash -> PowerShell):
#   breaker_load          -> Breaker-Load
#   breaker_should_skip    -> Breaker-ShouldSkip
#   breaker_record         -> Breaker-Record
#   breaker_current_model  -> Breaker-CurrentModel
#
# Cooldown threshold: 600s (OPEN -> HALF-OPEN eligible after 600s elapsed).
# Recovery threshold: HALF-OPEN closes at exactly 2 consecutive successes.
#
# State schema (flat JSON, one key per line — never nested, never minified/reflowed;
# both twins hand-write this exact layout so the file stays a byte-for-byte parity
# contract, not merely a JSON-equivalence one):
#   {
#   "state": "CLOSED"|"OPEN"|"HALF-OPEN",
#   "chain": "<comma-separated model chain, first = preferred>",
#   "fallbackIndex": <int, 0-based index of currentModel within chain — at chain
#     end the index stays put (pointing at the last entry) while currentModel
#     empties (omit-the-pin), so the two fields diverge by design>,
#   "currentModel": "<model id, or \"\" = omit the model flag/pin>",
#   "cooldownSeconds": 600,
#   "openedAt": <epoch seconds when OPEN was (re)entered, or 0>,
#   "halfOpenSuccesses": <int, consecutive successes while HALF-OPEN>,
#   "totalFallbacks": <int, lifetime>,
#   "totalRecoveries": <int, lifetime>
#   }
# NOTE: there is no `consecutiveFailures` key — it was a dead key in the original
# design note and is intentionally dropped from this schema.
#
# `chain` is normally seeded by the driver from the chain configured at install
# time (the LOOP_MODEL_CHAIN placeholder; see models.map.md's "Loop fallback
# chain" row) — this file never reads that token itself; the chain always
# arrives as a plain argument.
#
# Zero runtime deps: no jq/python/other JSON library. Parsing and persistence rely
# only on bash builtins plus grep (line presence), mv (atomic rename on write),
# sleep (torn-read retry backoff), and date — the latter only as breaker_load's
# default-parameter fallback when the caller does not inject a `now` — never
# `eval`, never `source`s the state file — because the flat, one-key-per-line
# layout above is simple enough that a real JSON parser buys nothing but a new
# dependency. This also means the state file is read as inert data: its bytes are
# never treated as code, so a corrupted or adversarially-edited file can only fail
# validation, not execute anything.
#
# Testability: transition logic (breaker_should_skip, breaker_record) takes
# timestamps as parameters — no wall-clock reads inside any transition logic.
# breaker_load's fail-safe seed is the one exception at the API boundary: its
# third parameter, `now`, is OPTIONAL and defaults to a wall-clock read
# (`date +%s`) only when the caller does not inject one, so every existing call
# site stays valid under `set -u` and the harness can still inject a timestamp for
# determinism. Wall-clock anomaly guard: the remaining-cooldown value is CLAMPED to
# [0, cooldownSeconds] so a system clock that jumps backward or forward can never
# produce a negative or absurdly long skip.
#
# Sourcing this file has zero side effects: it only defines functions.
