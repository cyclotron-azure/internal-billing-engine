# Autonomous feature loop for internal-billing-engine — drives one `auto-loop` iteration per
# fresh-context CLI run. State lives in _goals/backlog.md + git, never in memory.
#
# Twin: loop.ps1 (PowerShell 7+) — behaviorally identical —
# same defaults, guards, and exit codes; any divergence is a bug.
#
# Usage:   _loop/loop.sh [max-iterations]        (default 10)
# CLI:     override with LOOP_CLI, e.g. LOOP_CLI="codex exec" or LOOP_CLI="claude -p"
# SLOTS:   override with LOOP_SLOTS (default 2, clamped [1,3]) — N>1 is honored only
#          when LOOP_WORKTREE=1 (worktree isolation makes concurrent slots sound);
#          otherwise effective concurrency is held at 1.
# WORKTREE: override with LOOP_WORKTREE=1 to run each iteration in its own git worktree
#          under .loop-worktrees/ (default 0 = main tree, today's behavior).
#
# SAFETY: run inside a sandbox (worktree/container) with minimal credentials.
# This script never pushes and never bypasses permission prompts by itself.
#
# Breaker: sources breaker.sh (functions: breaker_load, breaker_should_skip,
# breaker_record, breaker_current_model); state file: _goals/breaker-state.json.
#
# Exit codes (driver-aggregated across slots, precedence 4>3>2>1>0 -- the most
# severe cause is always the one reported):
# 0 = backlog complete -- the driver's own backlog re-scan found no eligible
# story and no branch was quarantined this run. Under driver-owned dispatch a
# slot-emitted sentinel is an ITERATION-mismatch (contract violation), never a
# completion signal; the sentinel decides completion only in MANUAL
# (non-dispatched) auto-loop runs.
# 1 = stopped without completing the backlog -- max iterations reached with
# eligible stories remaining, or no eligible story remains but quarantined
# branches were retained this run (inspect them before trusting the backlog).
# 2 = circuit breaker -- every slot retired on no-progress (a slot retires,
# and is no longer refilled, after 3 consecutive no-commit reaps).
# 3 = circuit breaker -- every slot retired and at least one retirement was
# for 5 consecutive identical failure signatures (per-slot lineage).
# 4 = protected-path modification detected (iteration reverted; the run stops
# immediately and every other running slot is killed).
# 126/127 (shell-propagated edge cases, not loop-owned codes): command-not-found
# propagates as exit 127 and found-but-not-executable as exit 126 (bash) --
# standard shell convention, distinct from the aggregated codes above. The
# PowerShell twin's Get-Command guard does not attempt to distinguish the two
# and exits 127 for both -- a stated, knowingly-accepted platform difference
# (the 126 case is Unix-host-only).
# Exit 5 = setup or integration failure: the LOOP_WORKTREE=1 tracked-instance
# preflight failing after `git worktree add`, PROMPT.md missing a %%...%%
# substitution point, a missing/unreadable _goals/backlog.md, or the
# rebase-then-ff integration step hitting a non-fast-forward -- all loud,
# driver-level stops that never silently fall back to the main tree (the
# preflight path removes its worktree; the non-ff path retains worktree and
# branch for inspection).

# Capacity-contention rationale (why the design default is 2, not 3+): (1) one
# iteration fans out many subagents (implementer/test-writer execute, evaluator
# verifies every task, fixes are always re-evaluated), and that per-iteration
# fan-out multiplies by N against a shared ~20-concurrent subagent-spawn
# ceiling; (2) all N slots would authenticate through the same LOOP_CLI as one
# provider account, so they would share ONE rate-limit budget -- more slots
# raise request rate against an unchanged quota rather than adding real
# throughput; (3) the circuit breaker is provider-global (one state file, one
# 600s cooldown) -- a single OPEN trip stalls ALL N slots at once, so more
# slots raise the odds of a full-run stall without shortening it. N=3 crowds
# fact (1) hardest, which is why 2 (not 3) is the design default.

# Guard replacement (STORY-011, replaces the STORY-010 dark-launch guard):
# LOOP_SLOTS>1 is honored IFF LOOP_WORKTREE=1 -- per-slot worktree isolation
# is the mechanism that makes concurrent slots sound (disjoint checkouts);
# without it, N slots would share one working tree and stomp each other's
# checkout state. At LOOP_WORKTREE=0, EFFECTIVE_SLOTS clamps to 1 regardless
# of the requested SLOTS value, with a one-line stderr note fired only when
# >1 was EXPLICITLY requested (LOOP_SLOTS_EXPLICIT) -- never on every default
# run. THIS repo stays gitignored (worktree preflight is inoperable here), so
# live runs here remain serial N=1; N=2 behavior is proven in the harness's

# never `[[ output =~ pattern ]]` on the whole multi-line capture, whose `.` can cross
# line boundaries and falsely join unrelated lines (e.g. a bare token count on one line
# and the word "error" on another).
# Herestrings (`<<<`), not `printf | grep`, and a SINGLE grep per stage (no
# inter-grep pipe at all): under `set -o pipefail`, any pipeline whose
# downstream `grep -q` matches and exits early can SIGPIPE an upstream process
# still writing a large capture — pipefail then reports the pipeline's status
# as that upstream process's non-zero (SIGPIPE, 141, the rightmost NON-ZERO
# exit), not the downstream grep's own successful 0, silently flipping a real
# match into "no match". A herestring feeds data via a pre-materialized temp
# file with no live producer to SIGPIPE, closing that path for stage 1. Stage
# 2's "429 co-occurring with a keyword on the same line" no longer pipes one
# grep into another either: the co-occurrence is folded into ONE bidirectional
# alternation (`429.*(keyword)|(keyword).*429`) so a single process decides
# the whole stage — no process boundary for a downstream match to SIGPIPE
# across, at any capture size. Still strictly line-oriented (grep's `.` never
# crosses a newline), so a bare `429` on one line and a keyword on another
